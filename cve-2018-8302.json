            "description": "The Microsoft Exchange Server installed on the remote host is missing security updates. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Exchange software when the software fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in the context of the System user. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new accounts. Exploitation of the     vulnerability requires that a specially crafted email be     sent to a vulnerable Exchange server. The security     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how     Microsoft Exchange handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2018-8302)\n\n  - A tampering vulnerability exists when Microsoft Exchange     Server fails to properly handle profile data. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could modify a targeted user's profile data.\n    (CVE-2018-8374)",
